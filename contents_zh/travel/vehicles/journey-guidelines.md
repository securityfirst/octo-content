*   In insecure locations, all staff should be met on first arrival, and on subsequent arrivals if necessary.  Those meeting staff should carry identification.
*   Vary the time and route of any regular journeys you make.  If criminals can predict where you will be and when, it is easier for them to target you.
*   In remote areas or where threats may be present along the route, select primary and alternate routes.
*   Avoid areas with criminal activity or known threats. If possible avoid "choke points" such as narrow alleys.
*    When possible, consult with other agencies and organizations to monitor route conditions and change routes as necessary.
*   Notify others of travel times, destination, and steps they should take if you are late.
*   Mark official vehicles appropriately for the area.
*   Consider posting a decal on your door or window indicating guns are not permitted in the vehicle.
*   Avoid transporting sensitive documents or equipment in areas prone to banditry. Arrange proper permits for transporting items that could be interpreted as useful to combatants or terrorists.
*   Know how to perform basic vehicle maintenance (changing a flat tire, checking and adding fluids, etc.)
