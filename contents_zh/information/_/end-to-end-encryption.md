# End-to-end encryption

End-to-end encryption ensures that a message is turned into a secret message by its original sender, and decoded only by its final recipient. Other forms of encryption may depend on encryption performed by third parties. That means that those parties have to be trusted with the original text. End-to-end encryption is generally regarded as safer, because it reduces the number of parties who might be able to interfere or break the encryption.
