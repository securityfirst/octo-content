# Secure deletion on Windows

On Windows, we suggest using Eraser. Eraser is a free/open source secure deletion tool for Windows, and is much better than the built-in tools. To use Eraser, first [download the installer](http://eraser.heidi.ie/download/) from its website; make sure to choose a "stable" build. After the file downloads, double-click on it to launch it and Run the file.

Once Eraser is installed, if you want to securely delete a single file or folder, simply:

*    Right-click on the file or folder and choose Eraser > Erase from the right-click menu.

Alternatively, you may want to securely erase all the previously deleted data from your computer.

*   Launch Eraser.
*   Click the downward-pointing arrow next to "Erase Schedule" and choose "New Task."
*   In the "Task Properties" dialog that pops up, set the "Task Type" to "Run immediately."
*   Then click the "Add Data" button near the bottom of the dialog.
*   In the new "Select Data to Erase" dialog that pops up, choose "Unused disk space" and make sure the correct disk drive is selected in the drop down box (most likely the "(C:)" drive).
*   Click "OK" to exit both dialogs, and Eraser should start erasing.
*   Once it's done erasing, the task will disappear from the list of tasks in the "Erase Schedule."
