# Storage devices

Before you can back up your data, you must decide what kind of storage device you will use.

*   **USB sticks or external hard drives** - These are inexpensive, offer large capacity, and are easy to overwrite numerous times. USB sticks often have a lifetime of approximately ten years, with external hard drives lasting longer.
*   **CDs** - CDs store around 700 Megabytes (MB) of data. You will need a CD burner and blank discs. If you want to erase a CD and update the files stored on it, you will need to have a CD-RW burner and rewritable CDs. All major operating systems, including Windows XP, now include built-in software that can write CDs and CD-RWs. These discs may begin to deteriorate after five or ten years.
*   **DVDs** - DVDs store up to 4.7 Gigabytes (GB) of data. They work much like CDs but require slightly more expensive DVD or DVD-RW burner, and appropriate discs. As with a CD, the data written on a normal DVD will eventually begin to fade.
*   **Remote server** - A well-maintained network backup server may have almost unlimited capacity, but the speed and stability of your own Internet connection will determine whether or not this is a realistic option. Keep in mind that running a backup server in your own office, while faster than copying information over the Internet, violates the requirement that you keep a copy of your important data in two different physical locations. There are free storage services on the Internet, as well, but you should very carefully consider the risks of putting your information online and you should always encrypt your backups before uploading them to servers run by organisations or individuals whom you do not know and trust.
