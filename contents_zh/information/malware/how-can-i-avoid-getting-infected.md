# How can I avoid getting infected?

*   Always make sure you are running the latest version of your software and downloading the latest security patches. Only the latest updates have the latest protections. It is a common belief that if you are running an unregistered copy of Windows, you cannot or should not accept security updates. This is not true. Always update. [Secunia PSI](https://secunia.com/products/consumer/psi/sys_req/) for Windows is a free tool that will check to make sure your software is up to date.
*   Only download software from official sites.
*   Avoid opening suspicious attachments (anything from someone you don't know) or clicking on suspicious links (any links you didn't request)
*   If you are using Gmail, open unusual attachments in Google Drive rather than downloading them.
*   Double check the sender's email address if you get an email with an attachment or link you weren't expecting, even if the email appears to be written by a friend or colleague. If something seems odd or their tone is unusual, it doesn't hurt to email the friend to check they sent it and mention it to colleagues.
*   Stay alert when browsing websites. Watch for browser windows that appear automatically, and read them carefully. When in doubt, you should close 'pop up windows' by clicking the X in the upper corner, rather than by clicking Cancel.
*   Disconnect your computer from the Internet when you are not using it and shut it down completely overnight
