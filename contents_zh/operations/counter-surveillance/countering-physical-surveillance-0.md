It is obviously important to know how to identify if you, your colleagues, or partners are under surveillance.

Counter-surveillance is the process of detecting and mitigating hostile surveillance. This lesson lets you know how to practice counter-surveillance at one of the most important times - when you are in a vehicle, such as going to a sensitive meeting.
