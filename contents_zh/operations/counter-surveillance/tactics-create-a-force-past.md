# Tactics: Create a force-past

A force-past is when you create a situation in which someone following you would have to go past you or expose their position. There are several easily created force-past points:

*   Traffic crossing point
*   Bus stop
*   Taking an escalator
*   Using a lift to go up (until all passengers have left), then go down and exiting via an underground car park
*   Rapidly turning a corner then suddenly entering into a shop
*   Go into a shop/pub/building through one entrance and then rapidly exit via another
*   Corner hanging - turn a corner then rapidly stop
*   Change your clothing to make it harder to identify you
