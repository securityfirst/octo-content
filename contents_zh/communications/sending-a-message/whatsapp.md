# WhatsApp

WhatsApp is the most popular mobile communication tool in the world, offering free messaging to individuals and groups and operating on all phone types. Until November 2014, using WhatsApp was considered highly insecure and was not recommend for anyone who required any level of security in their communications. It now offers strong end-to-end encryption.

Since November 2014, WhatsApp has been partnering with and integrating the secure code of a well-respected privacy and technology company (Open Whisper Systems) into its product. This means that its messages now have a very strong level of  security, and WhatsApp can no longer easily view or be forced to handover messages to authorities.

However it is very important to note:

*   It does not encrypt any pictures sent once they arrive on the phone
*   While WhatsApp or others cannot view the content of your messages, they can still know that you are communication with someone (e.g metadata). In some cases, this may still have negative security consequences.
* 	It is possible for someone to try to intercept your communications by changing a contact's security code. To ensure you are warned about someone trying to do this, go to Settings -> Account -> Security -> Turn on "Show security notifications"

For these reasons we still recommend that you use Signal - available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms) and [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669) for secure messaging and calls.

**Two-Step Verification**

Two-step verification is an optional feature that adds more security to your WhatsApp account. When you have two-step verification enabled, any attempt to verify your phone number on WhatsApp must be accompanied by the six-digit passcode that you created using this feature.

To enable two-step verification, open WhatsApp > Settings > Account > Two-step verification > Enable.

Upon enabling this feature, you can also optionally enter your email address. This email address will allow WhatsApp to send you a link via email to disable two-step verification in case you ever forget your six-digit passcode, and also to help safeguard your account. WhatsApp does not verify this email address to confirm its accuracy. 

If you receive an email to disable two-step verification, but did not request this, do not click on the link. Someone could be attempting to verify your phone number on WhatsApp.

If you have two-step verification enabled, your number will not be permitted to reverify on WhatsApp within 7 days of last using WhatsApp without your passcode. If you forget your own passcode, but did not provide an email to disable two-step verification, you will not be permitted to reverify on WhatsApp within 7 days of last using WhatsApp. After these 7 days, your number will be permitted to reverify on WhatsApp without your passcode, but you will lose all pending messages upon reverifying - they will be deleted. If your number is reverified on WhatsApp after 30 days of last using WhatsApp, and without your passcode, your account will be deleted and a new one will be created upon successfully reverifying.

To help you remember your passcode, WhatsApp will periodically ask you to enter your passcode. There is no option to disable this without disabling the two-step verification feature.
