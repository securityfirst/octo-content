Experts recommend strict protocols when using satellite phones in a hostile environment:

*   Avoid using a satellite phone (or any radio frequency-based device) from the same location more than once.
*   Avoid using a satellite phone or similar device from a location that cannot be easily evacuated in case of attack.
*   Keep the maximum length of any transmission to 10 minutes. (Some experts warn that even this could be too long, as instantaneous tracking is at least possible.)
*   Turn off the machine and remove its battery as soon as the transmission is over and before traveling.
*   Avoid having multiple parties transmit from the same location.
