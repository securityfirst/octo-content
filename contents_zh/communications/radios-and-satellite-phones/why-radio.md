[Title]: # (Why Radio)
[Difficulty]: # (Beginner)
[Order]: # (5)

Radios are an insecure method of communication and should not be used for senstive communication if at all possible. If possible, use alternative options as outlined in the [Making a Call lesson](umbrella://lesson/making-a-call). However many in the humanitarian field still need to use them sometimes. If necessary, develop a system of code words between those communicating so that your message will not be so easily understood.
