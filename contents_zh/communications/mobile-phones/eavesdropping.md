## 4. Phones can be used to eavesdrop on the owner

If a phone is infected with the right malware it is possible for its microphone or camera to be turned on remotely allowing somebody to hear or see whatever is happening in the same room as the phone. This may happen even when the phone appears to be switched off.

As a result, people having a sensitive meeting or conversation are sometimes told to turn off their phones off and take out the battery. While this will make sure your phone can't be used to listen in on you, it does have its own disadvantage: if many people at one location all switch off their phones at the same time, it's a sign to the mobile carriers that they all thought something was worth them turning their phones off, such as a sensitive meeting.

An alternative that might give less information away is to leave phones in another room where the phones' microphones wouldn't be able to overhear the conversations. If you know this wouldn't be possible, try to take the battery out of your phone before you travel to the meeting.

Don't forget that using a phone in public, or in places that you don't trust, makes you vulnerable to traditional eavesdropping techniques, or to having your phone stolen.
