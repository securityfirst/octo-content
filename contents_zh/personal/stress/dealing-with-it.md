# Dealing with it

It is normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but in most people these will improve naturally over a few weeks. However you should visit your doctor if you are still having problems about four weeks after the traumatic experience, or if the symptoms are particularly troublesome. Your doctor may refer you to mental health specialists if they feel you would benefit from treatment.

PTSD can be successfully treated, even when it develops many years after a traumatic event. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and how soon they occur after the traumatic event. Any of the following treatment options may be recommended:

*   Watchful waiting - waiting to see whether the symptoms improve without treatment
*   Psychological treatment - such as psychotherapy or trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
*   Antidepressant medication
