If involved in an emergency evacuation by air remember that you may be weight-limited to 15 kilograms or even less. Ensure you prioritise carefully what you decide to take or you will be forced to leave items at the airstrip.

See the Evacuation lesson for details on what to do in cases of hibernation, relocation or evacuation.
