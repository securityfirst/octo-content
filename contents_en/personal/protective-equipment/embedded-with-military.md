[Title]: # (Embedded With Military)
[Difficulty]: # (Advanced)
[Order]: # (2)

Wear body armor whenever you are embedded with military forces. Body armor products are periodically updated as newer, lighter, and more reliable materials are developed. You will need to be mindful that different products may require different care. Ceramic plates may crack or break if they are dropped. Kevlar can deteriorate if it gets wet. Human sweat can degrade Kevlar and other products. Used body armor must be examined very carefully for signs of wear or weakening of fiber. All body armor must be properly stored and periodically inspected.
