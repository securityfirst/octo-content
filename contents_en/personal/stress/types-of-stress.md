<h1>Types of Stress</h1><p>Stress is a natural reaction, and it can be positive and stimulating. Not all stress is bad. There are different types of stress, both healthy and unhealthy. Healthy stress helps people focus on the task at hand, mobilises energy and prepares them for action. When stress occurs too often, however, or is too intense or lasts too long, it turns from positive to negative.</p><img src="stress1.png"><p>There are 3 different types of unhealthy stress: chronic, traumatic, and also post-traumatic.<br><br>1. Chronic stress is a combination of stress factors that builds up over time, eroding our resilience and ability to work or function effectively. This type of stress is dealt with below in the beginner?s lesson.<br><br>Traumatic stress results from directly experiencing, or being otherwise closely exposed to, traumatic events or incidents that are life- threatening or involve physical and emotional loss. It is dealt with in the Advanced lesson <br><br>Post-traumatic stress is prolonged stress which can occur months or even years after an event. It is dealt with in the Expert lesson.<br><br>People who have been trained about stress responses often react better under stress because they understand what is happening to them.</p><p>Each person will experience stress differently and therefore must manage their stress in their own way. Stress management varies by culture, gender, personality, identity and many other factors.</p>
