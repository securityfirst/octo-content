# Dealing with it - For Managers

In volatile environments, expectations of managers can often be unrealistic ? both in terms of the volume of tasks and the level of skill with which they need to be performed. The level of responsibility can be a significant source of stress, especially when it does not stop at night, or on weekends or holidays. All staff need to feel that their managers are strong, solid and reliable and a source of stability. A manager who shows signs of severe stress, or who continues in post although burned out, is likely to demoralise his or her staff. The following tactics can help managers to cope with their own stress and reduce that of their staff.

*   **Acknowledge your own limitations, to yourself and to your staff.** Admitting that you too are not immune to stress does not need to undermine your authority if you are managing according to principles and arguments that are defendable.
*   **Develop a good relationship with your own manager.** Ask them to come and experience at close hand the realities you are facing, and ask them to protect you from unnecessary pressures from HQ.
*   **Delegate.** Share tasks with your staff or try to create a senior management team around you that shares responsibility, although you remain the ultimate decision-maker. Insist on appointing a high-quality person when the post needs to be filled.
*   **The ?buddy system?.** Find a sounding board or possibly a buddy in one of your peers from another agency. Staff members may agree in advance to monitor each other?s reactions to identify signs of excessive stress and fatigue levels.
*   **Recognition of individual staff efforts.** Express appreciation on a regular basis. People do better in difficult situations when they feel that other people care about them. Provide constructive feedback to build self-confidence when addressing problem areas.
*   **Regular time off for all staff.** During periods of heavy workloads or in times of crisis, it is common for staff to attempt to work all day, every day. This can quickly lead to burnout. Many staff members need to be given permission to take care of themselves. Providing an afternoon off to a staff member who is obviously stressed ? and therefore often ineffective - can improve productivity in the long term. In emergency response situations, regular rotation of staff out of the hostile area every three to four weeks can help prevent build-up of excess stress.
*   **Provide a good example.** Demonstrate proper stress management by eating properly, resting and taking appropriate time off.
