<h1>Traumatic Stress - Causes</h1><p>Human rights activists do difficult and challenging work, and see a good deal of human misery. We may even be fearful for our lives at times. It is therefore important to know how to react following a traumatic event, and how to recognise the symptoms of traumatic stress. (Post-traumatic stress is dealt with in the Expert Lesson.)</p><p>Any event which is very distressing and outside of the realm of normal human experience can result in traumatic stress. Traumatic stress usually produces a very intense response, including fear and/or helplessness, which may overwhelm the individual?s coping mechanisms. Such a response is a <b>normal reaction to an abnormal situation.</b></p><img src="stress3.png">
