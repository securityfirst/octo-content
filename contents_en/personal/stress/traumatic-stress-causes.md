# Traumatic Stress - Causes

Human rights activists do difficult and challenging work, and see a good deal of human misery. We may even be fearful for our lives at times. It is therefore important to know how to react following a traumatic event, and how to recognise the symptoms of traumatic stress. (Post-traumatic stress is dealt with in the Expert Lesson.)

Any event which is very distressing and outside of the realm of normal human experience can result in traumatic stress. Traumatic stress usually produces a very intense response, including fear and/or helplessness, which may overwhelm the individual's coping mechanisms. Such a response is a **normal reaction to an abnormal situation.**
