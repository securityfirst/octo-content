# Chronic Stress - Causes

Chronic (or cumulative) stress occurs regularly among aid workers and activists, yet often goes unrecognised or unreported.

With healthy levels of stress, symptoms are generally mild and temporary ? people return to normal functioning when the stress factor is removed. If exposure to stress is excessive or long-term however, symptoms can persist and multiply, resulting in chronic or cumulative stress. Not only is this worse for the body physically and mentally, but chronic stress can also erode coping mechanisms.

Chronic stress builds slowly and may be hard to notice in yourself or others. If not properly managed, chronic stress can lead to burnout.
