#  Coping strategies

Everyone has natural ways of coping. Encourage people to use their own positive coping strategies, while avoiding negative strategies. This will help them feel stronger and regain a sense of control. You will need to adapt the following suggestions to take account of the person's culture and what is possible in the particular crisis situation.

**Encourage Positive Coping Strategies:**

*   Get enough rest.
*   Eat as regularly as possible and drink water.
*   Talk and spend time with family and friends.
*   Discuss problems with someone you trust.
*   Do activities that help you relax (walk, sing, pray, play with children).
*   Do physical exercise.
*   Find safe ways to help others in the crisis and get involved in community activities.

**Discourage Negative Coping Strategies:**

*   Don't take drugs, smoke or drink alcohol.
*   Don't sleep all day.
*   Don't work all the time without any rest or relaxation.
*   Don't isolate yourself from friends and loved ones.
*   Don't neglect basic personal hygiene.
*   Don't be violent.
