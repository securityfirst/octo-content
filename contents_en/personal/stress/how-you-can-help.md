<h1>How you can help</h1><p>What can you do straight after a trauma to help someone heal? Psychological First Aid is an important first step to support a traumatised person. It is NOT about encouraging or even forcing people to ?debrief? following a traumatic event. There should be no pressure on the affected person to recount what happened to them. It helps to provide a safe and supportive environment for people to feel secure. If they wish to share their experiences they can, but there is absolutely no obligation to do so.</p><p><ul><li>Ask someone if they require assistance. Remove the person from danger and try to keep them safe. If very distressed do not leave alone.</li><li>Ask about people?s needs. Do they need a blanket? Clothes? Medical treatment? Work with them to prioritise what they are most in need of and what is most important to them at this moment.</li><li>Listen to people and help them to feel calm.</li></ul></p>
