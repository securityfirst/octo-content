# Solid State Drive (SSD)

Historically, computers stored data on rotating magnetic discs. Mobile devices and increasing numbers of personal computers now store permanent data on non-moving drives. These SSD drives are currently more expensive, but much faster than magnetic storage. Unfortunately, it can be more difficult to reliably and permanently remove data from SSD drives.
