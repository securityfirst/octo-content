# One-time password

Passwords are usually semi-permanent: once you set them up, you can keep using them until you manually change or reset them. One-time passwords only work once. Some one-time password systems work by having a tool or program that can create many different one-time passwords, which you use in turn. This is useful if you're afraid that there may be a key -logger on a system where you have to type in a password.
