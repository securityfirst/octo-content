### 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start

Orbot provides Android devices with access to the Tor Network. Form more information see the **[Internet lesson](umbrella://lesson/the-internet)**

### 2.0 How to Install Orbot

**Step 1:** On your Android device, download and install the app from the [Google Play store here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android).
 ![image](tool_orbot2.png)

**Step 2:** Before the installation process begins, you will be prompted to review the access the application will have on your phone. Review this carefully. Once you are happy with the permissions that will be granted, press "Accept" and the installation will complete. If you do not agree with the permissions that will be granted, press the back button and the installation will be cancelled.

### 2.1 How to Configure Orbot

Using Orbot for the first time

**Step 1:** To open Orbot you tap the application's icon.
![image](tool_orbot3.png)

**Step 2:** Tap the language that you want and then tap "Next".

**Step 3:** A configuration wizard will appear with a description of Orbot. Read it and tap "Next".

**Step 4:** You will then be presented with a warning screen. Once you have read this and understand the requirements tap "Next".
![image](tool_orbot4.png)

**Step 5:** A screen will appear asking you to grant Orbot Superuser access. Superuser access requires that your device is rooted if you want to make use of Orbot's Transparent Proxy features - we will not explore this feature in the Orbot guide. (For information about rooting your phone, see the **[Mobile Phones, Expert lesson](umbrella://lesson/mobile-phones)**.)

If your smartphone is not rooted, just tick the option that states _I understand and would like to continue without Superuser_. The next screen explains in order for you to benefit from Tor, you will need to use apps built to work with Orbot, or that support HTTP or SOCKS proxy.

**Step 6:** A list of applications that work with Orbot will appear. Take note of them and tap "Next".

### 3.0.2 Browsing the internet anonymously

In order to browse or chat on the internet anonymously, you need to install an app which can route your browsing through a proxy in conjunction with Orbot. This is what Orbweb, the tool outlined below will do for you. 

### 3.1 Advanced Usage

### 3.1.1 New Identity

If at any stage you want to appear to come from a new location, you can get a _new identity_ from Orbot by swiping _left_ or _right_ on the green Orbot image. The image will briefly spin and then display _You've switched to a new Tor Identity_.
![image](tool_orbot12.png)

### 3.1.2 Using Bridges

If Tor access is restricted or illegal in your country, or you wish to disguise the fact that you are using Tor, you can configure Orbot to use bridges.

**Step 1:** Tap the icon with three staggered dots at the top of the screen to be brought to the settings screen.

**Step 2:** Scroll down to the bridges section and check the box next to Use Bridges.

### 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start

Orweb is a free Android-platform mobile phone application, created by the Guardian Project for browsing the internet anonymously in conjunction with Orbot.

**Note:** There is a bug in the current version of Orweb (0.6.1 and older) that may leak information about you, such as your IP address, to the website owners if you are viewing HTML5 based videos. Orweb will still allow you to circumvent censorship and prevent you from being spied on by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) but we do not recommend itto be used to view sites that may be considered hostile. For more information on the issue see the developers' response.

Orweb will only work properly after installing and configuring Orbot.

Remember, if you previously created a mail or blog without using Orweb, the site will still know your real location even if you return using Orweb.

If you want stronger anonymity while using Orweb other steps need to be taken including:

- Never access accounts made in your real name  
- Never give your personal data  
- Never do the same things that you do when not trying to be anonymous.

For an alternative that works with iOS on iPhones, use [OnionBrowser](https://mike.tig.as/onionbrowser/).

### 2.0 How to Install Orweb

**Step 1:** On your Android device, download and install the app from the [Google Play store here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.browser) by tapping "Install". 
![image](tool_orbot17.png)

**Step 2:** Before the installation process begins, you will be prompted to review the access the application will have on your phone. Review this carefully. Once you are happy with the permissions that will be granted, press "Accept" to start the installation. If you do not agree with the permissions that will be granted, press the back button and the installation will be cancelled.

**Step 3:** Once Orweb downloads and installation has completed, you can press "Open" to start the application.

### 3.0 Basic Usage

**Using Orweb for the first time**

**Step 1:** To open Orweb you tap the application's icon.
![image](tool_orbot18.png)

**Step 2:** Orweb will launch and automatically try to connect to _https://check.torproject.org_, to ensure that its connection to the Tor network is working. If it can connect, you will see a message telling you that your _browser is configured to use Tor_. If Orweb cannot connect to the website you will see an error message in the browser. If this happens, it is suggested that you check that Orbot is installed and running corectly on your android device if this happens.
