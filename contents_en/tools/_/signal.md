? Although it uses telephone numbers as contacts, calls actually use your data connection; therefore both parties to the conversation must have Internet access on their mobile devices.  
? Signal only encrypts calls that are between two Signal users, or between users of Signal and RedPhone, the app for Androids. (See **[RedPhone Tool Guide](umbrella://lesson/redphone)** for instructions for Androids)

Enter your mobile phone number and click ?Register.? In order to verify your phone number, you will be sent an SMS text with a six-digit code; enter the code in the space provided. If you are unable to receive SMS texts, you have the option of receiving a phone call to verify your phone number. Click ?Verify.?

### 2.0 Using Signal

In order to use Signal, the person that you are calling must have either Signal or RedPhone (for Android devices) installed. If you try to call someone using the Signal app and they do not have Signal or RedPhone installed, the app will ask if you would like to invite them via SMS, but it will not allow you to complete your call from inside the app.

### 2.1 How to Initiate an encrypted call

To initiate an encrypted call to a contact, you must use the dialer within the Signal app. (This differs from RedPhone for Android, which also allows you to use the default system dialer.)

Once a call is established, both parties to the call will be shown a random pair of words. This word pair will allow you to verify your identity and keys with the other user?also known as key verification.

The most trustworthy way to verify the identity of a caller is to use out-of-band authentication to verify the word pair. You can also read the words aloud if you recognize the caller?s voice, although very sophisticated attackers might be able to defeat this if they needed to. The word pair must be identical.
