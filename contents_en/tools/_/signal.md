The ability to make encrypted voice calls over a Wi-Fi or data connection using your normal phone number</p><p>NOTE: <br>? Although it uses telephone numbers as contacts, calls actually use your data connection; therefore both parties to the conversation must have Internet access on their mobile devices.<br>? Signal only encrypts calls that are between two Signal users, or between users of Signal and RedPhone, the app for Androids. (See <b><a href="umbrella://lesson/redphone">RedPhone Tool Guide</a></b> for instructions for Androids)</p><h3>1.0 How to install Signal </h3><p><b>Step 1:</b> Download and Install Signal ? Private Messenger</p><p>On your iOS device, enter the App Store and search for ?Signal.? Select the app ?Signal ? Private Messenger? by Open Whisper Systems.</p><p>Click to download the app and accept the iTunes Store Terms & Conditions by selecting ?Accept.? The app will download and install automatically. Click ?Open? to launch the app.</p><p><b>Step 2:</b> Register and Verify your Phone Number</p><p>You will see a screen that looks like this:</p><img src="tool_signal1.png"><p>Enter your mobile phone number and click ?Register.? In order to verify your phone number, you will be sent an SMS text with a six-digit code; enter the code in the space provided. If you are unable to receive SMS texts, you have the option of receiving a phone call to verify your phone number. Click ?Verify.?</p><h3>2.0 Using Signal</h3><p>In order to use Signal, the person that you are calling must have either Signal or RedPhone (for Android devices) installed. If you try to call someone using the Signal app and they do not have Signal or RedPhone installed, the app will ask if you would like to invite them via SMS, but it will not allow you to complete your call from inside the app.</p><img src="tool_signal2.png"><h3>2.1 How to Initiate an encrypted call</h3><p>To initiate an encrypted call to a contact, you must use the dialer within the Signal app. (This differs from RedPhone for Android, which also allows you to use the default system dialer.)</p><p>Once a call is established, both parties to the call will be shown a random pair of words. This word pair will allow you to verify your identity and keys with the other user?also known as key verification.</p><img src="tool_signal3.png"><p>The most trustworthy way to verify the identity of a caller is to use out-of-band authentication to verify the word pair. You can also read the words aloud if you recognize the caller?s voice, although very sophisticated attackers might be able to defeat this if they needed to. The word pair must be identical.</p>
