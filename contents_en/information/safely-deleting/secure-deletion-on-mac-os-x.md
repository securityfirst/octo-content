# Secure deletion on Mac OS X

On OS X 10.4 and above, you can securely delete individual files by simply:

*   Moving them to the Trash;
*   Then selecting Finder > Secure Empty Trash.

Alternatively, you may want to securely erase all the previously deleted data from your computer. Apple's advice on this is to:

*   Open Disk Utility (in Applications/Utilities);
*   Choose Help > Disk Utility Help;
*   Search for help on erasing free disk space.
