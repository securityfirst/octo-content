<h1>Limitations</h1><p>Unfortunately, there are limitations to secure deletion tools. Even if you follow the advice above and you?ve deleted all copies of a file, certain traces of deleted files, such as its name will probably continue to exist for some time on your computer. Overwriting the entire disk and installing a fresh operating system is the only way to be 100% certain that records of a file have been erased.</p><p>You may be wondering, "Could I search the raw data on the disk to see if there are any copies of the data anywhere?" The answer is yes and no. Searching the disk will tell you if the data is present in plaintext, but it won't tell you if some program has compressed or otherwise coded references to it. Also be careful that the search itself does not leave a record!</p>
