# Threat Modelling

There is no single solution for keeping your information safe. Managing your information securely isn?t about which tools you use; it?s about understanding the threats you face and how you can counter those threats. To become more secure, you should figure out what you need to protect, and whom you need to protect it from. Threats can change depending on where you?re located, what you?re doing, and whom you?re working with. The easiest way to figure out what solutions are best for you is to carry out aÂ threat modelling assessment.
