<h1>How to make a strong password</h1><p>A password should be difficult for a computer program to guess, difficult for others to figure out, and should be chosen so as to minimise damage if someone does learn it.</p><p><ul><li><b>Make it long:</b> The longer a password is, the longer takes to guess it. Use more than ten characters or ideally a long phrase or sentence. Short passwords of any kind, even totally random ones, are not strong enough for use with encryption today.</li><li><b>Make it complex:</b> Include upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and symbols.</li><li><b>Don't make it personal:</b> Don't choose a word or phrase based on information such as your name, telephone number, child's name, pet's name, birth date, or anything else that a person could learn by doing a little research about you.<br>? Keep it secret:</b> Do not share your password with anyone unless it is absolutely necessary. If you must share a password with a family member or colleague, you should change it to a temporary password first, share that one, then change it back when they are done using it. Often, there are alternatives to sharing a password, such as creating a separate account for each individual who needs access. Keeping your password secret also means not allowing anyone to see you typing it in.</li><li><b>Make it unique:</b> Avoid using the same password for more than one account. Otherwise, anyone who learns that password will gain access to even more of your sensitive information.</li><li><b>Keep it fresh:</b> Change your password on a regular basis, at least once every three months. The longer you keep one password, the more opportunity others have to figure it out and use it.</li><li><b>Make it memorable:</b> If you have to write your password down because you can't remember it, you may end up facing a whole new category of threats that could leave you vulnerable to anybody with access to your work area. If you are unable to think of a password that is long and complex but still memorable, the remembering secure passwords section, below, might be of some help. If not, you should still choose something secure, but you may need to record it using a secure password database such as <a href="umbrella://lesson/keepassx">KeePass</a>, outlined in our Advanced section. Other types of password-protected files, including Microsoft Word documents, should not be trusted for this purpose, as many of them can be broken in seconds using tools that are freely available on the internet.</li></ul></p><img src="password2.png">
