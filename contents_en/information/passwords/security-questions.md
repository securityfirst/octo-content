<h1>Security Questions</h1><p>Be aware of the ?security questions? (such as ?What is your mother?s maiden name?? or "What was your first pet's name?") that websites use to confirm your identity if you do forget your password. Honest answers to many security questions are publicly discoverable facts that a can be easily found, and therefore bypass your password entirely. Instead, give fictional answers that, like your password, no one knows but you. For example, if the password question asks you your pet?s name, you may have posted photos to photo sharing sites with captions such as ?Here is a photo of my cute cat, Spot!? Instead of using ?Spot? as your password recovery answer, you might choose ?Rumplestiltskin.?</p>
