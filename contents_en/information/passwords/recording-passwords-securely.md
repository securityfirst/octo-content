<h1>Recording passwords securely</h1><p>Our Basic section showed you how to create a strong, memorable password. However, because you need a different password for every account or service and also need to change them every few months, it can soon become difficult to remember them all. Fortunately, there are software tools to help with this ? a password manager is a software application that can generate random, secure passwords for each of your accounts and record them in a portable, encrypted password database, such as KeePass.</p><img src="password_adv1.png"><p>The password manager protects all of your passwords with a single master password so you only have to remember one thing. Of course, if you use this method, it becomes especially important that you create and remember a very secure password for KeePass, or whatever tool you choose. Whenever you need to enter a password for a specific account, you can look it up using only your master password, which makes it much easier to follow all of the suggestions above.</p><p>KeePass sits on your desktop, and it also portable, which means that you can put the database on a USB memory stick in case you need to look up a password while you are away from your primary computer.</p><p>You can learn how to set up and use this tool in the <a href="umbrella://lesson/keepassx">Keepass tool guide</a>.</p>
