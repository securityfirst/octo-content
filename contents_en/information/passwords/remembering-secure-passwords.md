MarSter'</li><li><b>Alter numbers and letters, such as:</b> 'a11 w0Rk 4nD N0 p14Y'</li><li><b>Incorporate symbols, such as:</b> 'c@t(heR1nthery3'</li><li><b>Use multiple languages, such as:</b> 'Let Them Eat 1e gateaU au ch()colaT'</li><li><b>Use acronyms:</b> 'Are you happy today?' becomes 'rU:-)2d@y?'</li></ul></p><p>A little effort to make the password more complex goes a very long way. Increasing the length of a password even just by a few characters, or by adding numbers or special characters, makes it much more difficult to crack.</p><p>You can check the strength of passwords on <a href="https://passfault.appspot.com/password_strength.html">Passfault</a>.</p>
