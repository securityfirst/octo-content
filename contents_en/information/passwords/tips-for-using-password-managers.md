# Tips for using password managers

There are few things to keep in mind when using password databases.

*   If you lose or accidentally delete your only copy of a password database, you will no longer have access to any of the accounts for which it contained passwords. This makes it extremely important that you back up your KeePass database. Read our [Backing Up lesson](umbrella://lesson/backing-up) for instructions on how to do this.
*   If you forget your KeePass master password, there is no way to recover it or the contents of the database. So, be sure to choose a master password that is both secure and memorable!

*   It is also crucially important to keep your password manager itself secure.

- Some password managers will offer to store your passwords "in the cloud," which is to say, they will store your passwords encrypted on a remote server, and when you need them on a laptop or mobile, they will retrieve and decrypt them for you automatically. Password managers like this are more convenient, but the trade-off is that they are more vulnerable to attack. If you just keep your passwords on your computer, then someone who can take over your computer may be able to get hold of them. If you keep them in the cloud, your attacker may target that also. It's not usually a compromise you need to worry about unless your attacker has legal powers over the password manager company or is known for targeting companies or internet traffic.
*   When you use a password manager, the security of your passwords and your master password is only as strong as the security of the computer where the password manager is installed and used. If your computer or device is compromised and spyware is installed, the spyware can watch you type your master password and could steal the contents of the password safe. So it's still very important to keep your computer and other devices clean of malicious software when using a password manager.
