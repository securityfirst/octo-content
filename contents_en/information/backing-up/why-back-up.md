# Why back-up?

Backing up is the copying and archiving of computer data so it can retrieve it if something happens to the original. Years of work can disappear in an instant as a result of theft, carelessness, confiscation, or breakage, so it is extremely important to have an up-to-date backup and a well-tested means of restoring it.

Creating an effective backup policy can be tricky for a few reasons:

*   The need to store original data and backups in different physical locations;
*   The importance of keeping backups confidential;
*   The challenge of coordinating among different people who share information with one another using their own portable storage devices.
