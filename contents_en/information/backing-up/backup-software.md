<h1>Backup Software</h1><p>Cobian Backup is a user-friendly tool that can be set to run automatically, at regularly scheduled times, and to include only files that have changed since your last backup. It can also compress backups to make them smaller. You can learn how to install and run it in our <a href="umbrella://lesson/cobian-backup">Cobian Backup</a> Guide.</p><p>When using these backup tools, there are a few things you can do to help your backup system work smoothly:<ul><li>Organise the files on your computer. Try to move all of the folders that contain electronic documents you intend to back up into a single location, such as inside the My Documents folder.</li><li>If you use software that stores its data in an application database, you should first determine the location of that database. If it is not in a convenient location, see if the program will allow you to choose a new location for its database. If it does, you can put it in the same folder as your electronic documents.</li><li>Create a regular schedule to perform your backup.</li><li>Try to establish procedures for all of the staff in your office who do not already have a reliable, secure backup policy. Help your colleagues understand the importance of this issue.</li><li>Make sure to test the process of recovering data from your backup. Remember that, in the end, it is the restore procedure, not the backup procedure, which you really care about!</li></ul></p><p>Once you have backed up your information or created a back-up process, you need to figure out a safe place to store it. Remember, this needs to be a different location to the one where the original information is! (i.e. if backing up your office files, the usb stick you use should not be kept in the office)</p>
