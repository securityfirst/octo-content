<h1>Identifying and organising your information</h1><p>The first step to formulating a backup policy is to figure out where all your personal and work information is currently located. This may include the following:<ul><li>Email may be stored on the provider's mail server, on your own computer, or both.</li><li>Documents, address books, or chat histories on the computers you use, which may be in the office or at home.</li><li>Information may also be stored on USB sticks, portable hard drives, or CDs.</li><li>Contacts and important text messages on your mobile phone.</li><li>Your website may contain important information or collection of work.</li><li>Don't forget your non-digital information, such as paper notebooks, diaries and letters.</li></ul></p><p>Next, you need to work out which of these files are 'master copies,' and which are duplicates. The master copy is generally the most up-to-date version of a file and is the one you will want to back-up.</p><p>You should make a table of all the information types you identified above and for each of them note:<ul><li>Whether that information is master copy or duplicate;</li><li>The device or devices they are stored on;</li><li>The physical location that the device is usually kept.</li></ul></p><p>This table will help you see which of your information (or master copies) is only in one location and therefore vulnerable.</p><img src="backing1.png">
