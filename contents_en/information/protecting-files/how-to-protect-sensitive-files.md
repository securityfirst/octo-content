<h1>How to protect sensitive files</h1><p>Many human rights activists have sensitive information that could have serious consequences if seen by the wrong people. The <a href="umbrella://lesson/managing-information">Managing Information lesson</a> can help you determine your threat model. Following the steps laid out in the Home/Office section and the <a href="umbrella://lesson/malware">Malware</a> lesson will help you to protect your computer physically and digitally. However there may be situations where these precautions fail or you need to show your computer to someone whom you don?t want to see the files. This is why you should also protect the files themselves. You can do this by encrypting them so that only you can read them.</p><img src="protecting1.png"><p>Encryption is a way to enhance the security of a message or file by scrambling the contents so that it can only be read by someone who has the right encryption key to unscramble it.Many activists use TrueCrypt, but serious vulnerabilities have recently been found in it. <a href="https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Downloads">VeraCrypt</a> is a good, free, open-source, alternative that we recommend instead. Much like a safe, VeraCrypt creates an encrypted container on your computer or hard drive, that you can put as many files as you like into.</p><p>We will shortly be creating a tool guide for VeraCrypt. For now, users can get a step-by-step guide of how to use and install it <a href="https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Beginner%27s%20Tutorial">here</a>.</p>
