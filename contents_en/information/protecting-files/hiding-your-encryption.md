<h1>Hiding your encryption</h1><p>If you are concerned about encryption software being found on your computer regardless of what?s in it, there are a few tricks to help disguise VeraCrypt.</p><p><ul><li>You can rename your encrypted volume to look like a different type of file. Using the '.iso' file extension, to disguise it as a CD image, is one option that works well for large volumes of around 700 MB. Other extensions would be more realistic for smaller volumes.</li><li>You can also rename the VeraCrypt program itself, assuming you have stored it as you would a regular file, rather than installing it as a program. The <a href="umbrella://lesson/truecrypt">VeraCrypt Guide</a> explains how to do this.</li></ul></p>
