# Hiding your encryption

If you are concerned about encryption software being found on your computer regardless of what's in it, there are a few tricks to help disguise VeraCrypt.

*   You can rename your encrypted volume to look like a different type of file. Using the '.iso' file extension, to disguise it as a CD image, is one option that works well for large volumes of around 700 MB. Other extensions would be more realistic for smaller volumes.
*   You can also rename the VeraCrypt program itself, assuming you have stored it as you would a regular file, rather than installing it as a program. The [VeraCrypt Guide](umbrella://lesson/truecrypt) explains how to do this.
