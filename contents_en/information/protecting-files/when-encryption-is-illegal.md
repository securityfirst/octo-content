<h1>When encryption is illegal</h1><p>Encryption is illegal in some countries, which means that downloading, installing or using software of this sort might be a crime in its own right. Any time that merely being associated with encryption software would be enough to expose you to accusations of criminal activity or espionage (regardless of what is actually inside your encrypted volumes), then you will have to think carefully about whether or not such tools are appropriate for your situation.</p><p>If that is the case, you have a few options:<ul><li>Store only non-confidential information</li><li>Use a system of code words to protect key elements of your sensitive files</li><li>Store all of your sensitive information in a secure webmail account ? you would need a reliable network connection and an advanced understanding of computers and Internet services</li><li>Keep sensitive information off of your computer by storing it on a USB stick or portable hard drive ? carrying around sensitive, unencrypted information is usually a very bad idea so you would need to keep the device in a very secure place</li></ul></p>
