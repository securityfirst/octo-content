# A secret safe within a safe

One of the weaknesses with some encryption tools is their visibility - you may be worried that someone could find the encrypted volume, see that you were trying to conceal information, and use intimidation, blackmail or interrogation to force you into opening it.

However VeraCrypt allows you to create a secret volume, inside your regular encrypted volume, to hide your most sensitive information. It is similar to installing a secret 'false bottom' inside your office safe. If an intruder steals your key, or intimidates you into giving them the safe's combination, they will find some convincing decoy material, but not the information that you truly care about protecting.

You open this secret volume by providing an alternate password that is different from the one you would normally use. Even if a technically sophisticated intruder gains access to the standard volume, he will be unable to prove that a hidden one exists.
