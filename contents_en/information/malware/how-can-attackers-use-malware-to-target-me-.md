<h1>How can attackers use malware to target me?</h1><p>The most common method of attack is to trick you into installing the malware yourself. There are many ways they try to do this.<br><ul><li>They may disguise the malware as a link to a website, a document, a software update, or even a program designed to help secure your computer.</li><li>You may be targeted via email (which may look as if it?s coming from someone you know), via a message on Skype or Twitter, or even via a link posted to your Facebook page.</li><li>You can also infect your computer by connecting infected hardware, like a USB key given to you or found near your office, or a phone connected to charge.</li></ul></p><img src="malware3.png"><p>The more targeted the attack the more they?ll try to make it look like something you want to open. For example, in Syria, pro-Assad hackers targeted members of the opposition with malware hidden in fake revolutionary documents and a fake anti-hacking tool. And in Morocco, activists were targeted with malware hidden in a document made to look as if it had been sent by an Al-Jazeera reporter, promising information about a political scandal.</p><p>There is also the possibility of someone gaining physical access to your computer to install malware themselves.
