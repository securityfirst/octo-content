# Preventing virus or spyware infection

*   If you need to open a file from someone you don?t know well, you should save the attachment to a folder on your computer, then open the appropriate application (such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat) yourself. If you use the program's File menu to open the attachment manually, rather than double-clicking the file or allowing your email program to open it automatically, you are less likely to contract a virus.
*   Hover over URLs and hyperlinks to check where they lead. If you're unsure about a URL, check it at [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/#url).
*   Before inserting removable media, such as CDs or USB sticks, into your computer, you should disable your operating system's 'AutoPlay' feature. (This is usually found under the Properties section of My Computer)
*   Improve the security of your Web browser by preventing it from automatically running the potentially dangerous programs that are sometimes contained within webpages you visit. If you are using Mozilla Firefox, you can install the NoScript add-on.
*   Download over an encrypted connection (usually SSL in the browser) whenever possible.
*   Using free and open-source software significantly lowers your risk of being infected by malware. These tools are often written and updated for free by volunteers and are generally more secure than their proprietary alternatives. In particular, you should consider replacing Internet Explorer, Outlook and Microsoft Office with Firefox, Thunderbird and LibreOffice, respectively. You should also consider switching from the Microsoft Windows operating system to a more secure open-source alternative like Ubuntu or ChromeOS.
