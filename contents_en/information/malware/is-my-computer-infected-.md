# Anti-virus software

You should always use anti-virus software on your computer and your smartphone, which are easily available to buy and download. [Avast](https://www.avast.com) is an easy to use anti-virus program for Windows. [Clam Win](http://www.clamwin.com/) is a good open source alternative.  Anti-virus software can be quite effective at combatting cheap, ?non targeted? malware that might be used by criminals against hundreds of targets. However such software is usually ineffective against targeted attacks, such as ones carried out by governments against.

## How can I tell if my computer is compromised?

Malware is very difficult to detect. Scanners such as [Spybot](https://www.safer-networking.org/) or [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.org/) can detect and protect against some malware threats and are useful to use.  
While most malware avoids detection by software, it is still sometimes possible to find indicators of it on your computer. For example, services will sometimes send you a warning email if they believe your account has been targeted, you may notice a light indicating that your webcam is turned on when you have not activated it yourself, or your settings have been altered to send copies of your emails to an unfamiliar email address.
