# What is malware?

Malware, short for "malicious software," is software that is used to harm computer users. It can do things like gather information, impersonate a user, gain access to other computers, or stop a computer from working. It could do this by allowing an attacker to record from a webcam and microphone, disabling anti-virus programs, recording keystrokes, copying emails and other documents, stealing passwords, and more. Most malware is criminal and is often used to obtain banking information or other valuable information. However, it is also used by governments, law enforcement agencies, and even private citizens to spy on users.
