<h1>Tips on using anti-virus software effectively</h1><p>The beginner section gave a run through of useful anti-virus software such as <a href="https://www.avast.com">Avast</a> or <a href="http://www.clamwin.com/">Clam Win</a> and anti-malware software such as <a href="https://www.safer-networking.org/">Spybot</a> or <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/">Malwarebytes</a>. There are a few ways in which you can make sure you get the most out of your software.</p><img src="malware_adv1.png"><p><ul><li>Do not run two anti-virus programs at the same time, as this might cause your computer to run extremely slowly or to crash. Uninstall one before installing another. However anti-malware software is designed to work alongside anti-virus software.</li><li>Make sure that your anti-virus program updates itself regularly. Without updates it can quickly become ineffective. All of the software recommended here supports free updating.</li><li>Enable your anti-virus software's 'always on' virus-detection feature if it has one. It may also be called 'Realtime Protection,' 'Resident Protection,' or something similar.</li><li>Scan all of the files on your computer regularly. You don't have to do this every day but you should do it from time to time. How often may depend on the circumstances. Have you connected your computer to unknown networks recently? With whom have you been sharing USB memory sticks? Do you frequently receive strange attachments by email? Has someone else in your home or office recently had virus problems? Tools such as Avast can do this for you.</li></ul></p>
