# What should I do if I find malware on my computer?

*   The first thing you should do if you find malware on your computer is unplug your computer from the Internet and stop using it immediately. Every keystroke you make may be being sent to an attacker.
*   Log into a computer you believe is safe and change your passwords; every password that you typed on your computer while it was infected should now be considered to be compromised.
*   You may wish to reinstall the operating system (eg Windows, Android, IOS) on your computer in order to remove the malware. This will remove most malware, but some especially sophisticated malware may persist.
*   If you can, take your computer to a security expert, who may be able to discover more details about the malware.
*   If you have some idea of when your computer was infected, you may reinstall files from before that date. Reinstalling files from after the date of infection may re-infect your computer.
