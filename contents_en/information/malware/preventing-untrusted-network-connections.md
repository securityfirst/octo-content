# Preventing untrusted network connections

*   A firewall helps to protect your computer from unauthorised connections to and from the Internet. It can also help reduce the spread of malware if you are infected.  Most operating systems have firewalls included but check to make sure they are turned on. (You can usually find this under Control Panel > Security) There are also excellent freeÂ programs such as [Comodo](https://securityinabox.org/comodofirewall_main) Personal Firewall, which can help keep your computer secure.
*   Make sure that all of the computers on your office network have a firewall installed. Read more about this in the Network Section.
*   Only install essential programs on the computer you use for sensitive work, and make sure you get them from a reputable source. Uninstall any software that you do not use.
