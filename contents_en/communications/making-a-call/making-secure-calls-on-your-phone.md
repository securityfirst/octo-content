# Making secure calls on your phone

## Signal

Signal is a free, simple open-source tool for having end-to-end encrypted phone calls and also for sending secure messages.  It works for both Androids and iPhones and replaces the previous android app called Redphone. (Users with RedPhone installed will be prompted to install Signal instead. If you already have Signal installed, you can just uninstall RedPhone. It will no longer be maintained as an independent app.)

Signal now also incorporates secure messaging app, Textsecure ? meaning there is one simple app you can use for both secure calling and messaging, whether on Android or iPhone, as long as the person you are communicating with has Signal too.

Signal uses your existing phone number and address book. There are no separate logins, usernames, passwords, or PINs to manage or lose.Â It uses your mobile number as your identificator (like a user name) ? this makes it easier for the user, though it also makes it easier to analyze the traffic it produces and trace it back to you. Signal uses a central server, which is a point of centralization and thus puts it in the powerful position of having control over some of this data. However they cannot hear your conversations or see your messages, so no one else can either.

## Ostel

Another notable tool for having end-to-end encrypted phone calls is OStel. It works on every smartphone (Blackberry, iPhone, Nokia, Android) and every desktop (Mac, PC, Linux, etc). It is one of the most secure means to communicate via voice and comes with many easy set-up wizards for different VoIP services, available [here](https://ostel.co/). (The accompanying app for Android phones is CSipSimple.) Both you and the person you want to talk to will need an ostel account. It securely encrypts all your speech and makes it very difficult to trace your data and find out who you are talking to. If you download CSipSimple from ostel.co it also comes preconfigured for use with ostel, which makes it very easy to install and use.

## Redphone

[RedPhone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone) is a free and open-source tool for having end-to-end encrypted phone calls that works only on Android phones. It is easy to install and very easy to use, since it integrates itself into your normal dialing and contacts system. People you want to talk to also need to install and use RedPhone (or, if they have iPhones, Signal, as noted below). For ease of use RedPhone uses your mobile number as your identificator (like a user name on other VoIP services). However it also becomes easier to analyze the traffic it produces and trace it back to you, through your mobile number. RedPhone uses a central server, which is a point of centralization and this puts RedPhone in a powerful position (of having control over some of this data).  
You can learn how to set it up simply in the RedPhone tool guide.

Signal is the version of RedPhone that works on iPhones. The two systems are fully compatible and can be used to communicate securely with one another. Learn how to set it up in the Signal tool guide.
