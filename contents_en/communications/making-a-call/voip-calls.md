<h1>VoIP Calls</h1><p>The easiest way to ensure you have good encryption on voice conversations is to use VoIP instead of regular calls. VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) refers to calls made using the internet. Using VoIP is generally free (or significantly cheaper than mobile phone calls) and leaves few data traces. Good call encryption software is currently only supported on a few models of smart phones.</p><p>In order to have end-to-end encrypted VoIP conversations, both parties must be using the same (or compatible) software. Conversations between providers such as Skype and mobile phones are not encrypted either, since at some point, the signal will move to the mobile network, where encryption is NOT in place.</p>
