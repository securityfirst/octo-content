# Virtual Private Networks

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts and sends all Internet data between your computer and another computer. This computer could belong to a commercial or non-profit VPN service, your company, or a trusted contact. A proxy server is mainly for web traffic only, but a VPN encrypts and protects all traffic. The main difference is that a VPN server encrypts your data, but a proxy server does not. A VPN also lets you use more than just the Internet ? you can use it to access webpages, e-mail, instant messaging, VoIP and any other Internet service.

## Psiphon3

Psiphon3 is a secure, public circumvention tool that combines VPN, SSH and HTTP Proxy technology to provide you with uncensored access to Internet content. It is available free online for Windows and Android. You can learn how to use it in the [Psiphon3 tool guide](umbrella://lesson/psiphon).  
Because Psiphon 3 is VPN-based, it is able to proxy all of your Internet traffic, not just websites. It should be noted that although Psiphon is does not allow individual user?s IP addresses to be associated with any individual website visited, Psiphon is intended primarily as a censorship evasion tool, rather than one that guarantees anonymity.

While a VPN protects your traffic from being intercepted locally, your VPN provider can still keep logs of what websites you access or even provide a third party with the ability to snoop directly on your web browsing. Depending on your threat model, the possibility of a government listening in on your VPN connection or obtaining the logs may be a significant risk and, for some users, could outweigh the short-term benefits of using a VPN. These users, or anyone who requires total anonymity online, should use Tor, as described in the Advanced section of this lesson.
