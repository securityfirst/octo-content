# Circumventing censorship from your smartphone

Using your smartphone to go online is often risker than using a computer. You can reduce your risks through the use of these tools.

Using a VPN on your mobile will give you uncensored access to Internet content while encrypting what you do.  We recommend using the Psiphon3 tool, outlined above, which works on Androids as well as Windows.

Users with a high threat model who need to ensure total anonymity online should use tools outlined in the Advanced section of this lesson.

## Proxies

Using proxies on your mobile phone will allow you to access otherwise blocked websites. You can access proxies by downloading the mobile version of Firefox ? [Firefox mobile](http://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.mozilla.firefox) along with the [Proxy Mobile](https://guardianproject.info/apps/proxymob-firefox-add-on/) add-on which makes proxying with Firefox easy. It is helpful in cases of censorship, but still may reveal your requests unless the connection from your client to the proxy is encrypted. This can be used on Androids as well as iPhones.
