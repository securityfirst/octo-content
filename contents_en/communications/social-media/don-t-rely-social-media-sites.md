# Don't use social media sites for instant chats

Many social networking sites have tools that allow you to have discussions with your friends in real time. These operate like Instant Messaging and are one of the most insecure ways to communicate on the internet, both because they may reveal who you are communicating with, and what you are communicating about.

Never engage in chats with people you don't know, especially those who want to send you documents or pictures. This is a method commonly used by authorities to put malware in activists' computers.

You should use a specific application for your chats, such as Pidgin with an Off-the-record plugin, which uses encryption. Read the [Sending a Message lesson](umbrella://lesson/sending-a-message) or [Pidgin tool guide](umbrella://lesson/pidgin) to find out how. 

## Don't rely on social media for storage

Be cautious about how safe your content is on a social networking site. Never rely on a social networking site as a primary host for your content or information. It is very easy for governments to block access to a social networking site within their boundaries if they suddenly find its content objectionable.
