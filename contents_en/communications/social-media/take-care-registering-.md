# Take care registering 

*   Consider whether you want to use your real name or not. Might you want to share things that could be dangerous if they were linked to you?
*   When you register, don't provide more information than is necessary. Do you really need to include your birthday/contact number/employment details?
*   If you are concerned with hiding your identity, use a separate email address. Be aware that your IP address may be logged at registration, so for full, guaranteed anonymity you may want to use a VPN or even Tor.*   Consider using separate accounts/identities, or maybe different pseudonyms, for different campaigns and activities.*   Choose a strong password, change it regularly and, if possible, enable two-factor authentication.
*   Beware of password recovery/security questions whose answers can be mined from your social media details. For example: ?What city were you born in?? or ?What is the name of your pet?? You may want to choose password recovery answers that are false. One good way to remember the answers to password recovery questions, should you choose to use false answers for added security, is to note your chosen answers in a password safe. See the [Password lesson](umbrella://lesson/passwords) for more information on how to choose and remember strong passwords.
*   Only connect to people you know personally and trust.
