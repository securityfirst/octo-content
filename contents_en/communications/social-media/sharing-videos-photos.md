# Sharing videos/photos

Photos and videos can reveal people's identities very easily. It's important that you have the consent of the subject/s of any photo or video that you post. If you are posting an image of someone else, be aware of how you may be compromising their privacy. Never post a video or photo of anyone without getting their consent first. As a good rule of thumb, don't post information, images, or updates about people you know if they aren't posting about themselves.

Photos and videos can also reveal a lot of information unintentionally. Many cameras will embed hidden data (metadata tags), that reveal the date, time and location of the photo, camera type, etc. Photo and video sharing sites may publish this information when you upload content to their sites.

[Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/) has created an open-source app called [ObscuraCam](umbrella://lesson/obscuracam) to detect/select faces on photos and blur them. Obscuracam also deletes the original photos and if you have set up a server to upload the captured media, it provides an easy way to upload it.
