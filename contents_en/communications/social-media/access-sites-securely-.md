<h1>Access sites securely</h1><p>Access social networking sites using https:// to safeguard your username, password and other information you post. Using https:// rather than http:// adds another layer of security by encrypting the traffic from your browser to your social networking site. </p><p>Be careful when accessing your social network account in public internet spaces. Delete your password and browsing history when using a browser on a public machine.</p>
