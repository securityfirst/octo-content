# Access sites securely

Access social networking sites using https:// to safeguard your username, password and other information you post. Using https:// rather than http:// adds another layer of security by encrypting the traffic from your browser to your social networking site. 

Be careful when accessing your social network account in public internet spaces. Delete your password and browsing history when using a browser on a public machine.
