# Check what your friends share about you

Remember that you?re not the only person who can give away potentially sensitive data about yourself.Â Your friends can tag you in photos, report your location, and make their connections to you public in a variety of ways. You may have the option of untagging yourself from these posts, but privacy does not work retroactively. You may want to talk to your friends about what you do and do not feel comfortable having them share about you in public.
