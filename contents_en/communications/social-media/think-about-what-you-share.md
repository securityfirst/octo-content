<h1>Think about what you share</h1><p>Always ask the questions:<ul><li>Who can access the information I am putting online?</li><li>Who controls and owns the information I put into a social networking site?</li><li>What information about me are my contacts passing on to other people?</li><li>Will my contacts mind if I share information about them with other people?</li><li>Do I trust everyone with whom I'm connected?</li></ul></p><p>Be careful about putting too much information into your status updates ? even if you trust the people in your networks. It is easy for someone to copy your information or unintentionally share something.</p><p>It's easy to share a link to a website and get your friend's attention. But who else will be paying attention, and what kind of reaction will they have? </p><img src="socialb3.png">
