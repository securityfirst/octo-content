<p>Experts recommend strict protocols when using satellite phones in a hostile environment:<ul><li>Avoid using a satellite phone (or any radio frequency-based device) from the same location more than once.</li><li>Avoid using a satellite phone or similar device from a location that cannot be easily evacuated in case of attack.</li><li>Keep the maximum length of any transmission to 10 minutes. (Some experts warn that even this could be too long, as instantaneous tracking is at least possible.)</li><li>Turn off the machine and remove its battery as soon as the transmission is over and before traveling.</li><li>Avoid having multiple parties transmit from the same location.</li></ul></p>
