<h2>High Frequency radios</h2><p>HF (High Frequency) radios, in the 3 to 30 MHz frequency range, allow voice communications over medium and long range (conceivably around the world). Less affected by obstacles, HF signals can ?bend? around hills and buildings and do not require repeaters to function over long ranges. However, the transmission range of HF signals may be influenced by time of day, weather conditions, electrical interference, and poor system configuration. It takes skill to achieve reliable HF connectivity over long distances. HF radios are often installed in vehicles or at base stations. HF systems are generally more expensive than VHF and require more maintenance. </p><p>The advantages of HF radios are: <ul><li>Short- to extremely long-range communication without a relay station; </li><li>Less affected by topographical variation; </li><li>High degree of independence; </li><li>Easy to network, with multiple stations sharing the frequency; </li><li>Messages can be sent simultaneously to multiple destinations; </li><li>Monitoring is simple; </li><li>Well-adapted for use in vehicles; </li><li>Adaptable to changing operational conditions; </li><li>Relatively cheap to purchase; no call charges; </li><li>Relatively easy to diversify functions of the network (voice, fax, GPS tracking, SITOR or PACTOR data transmission); </li><li>Possible to integrate with other networks (phone/email); and</li><li>Requires limited maintenance.</li></ul></p><p>The disadvantages are: <ul><li>Not secure ? anybody can listen in;</li><li>Requires registration and licensing in most countries; </li><li>Transmission strength varies during the day depending on solar activity; </li><li>?skip zone?: no reception between maximum extent of direct wave (ground wave)  and  longer  radius  starting  with  the  closest  reflections  from  the ionosphere; </li><li>Staff have to be trained in order to take full advantage of the network; and</li><li>Technical expertise needed for installation, and HF can interfere with other electronic equipment if not installed correctly.</li></ul></p>
