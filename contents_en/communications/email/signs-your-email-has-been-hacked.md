# Signs your email has been hacked

## Signs

If you suspect your email account has been hacked or compromised, you can take steps to reduce the damage done. While it is difficult to be certain, there may be clues such as:

*   You notice any changes to your email account content or settings that you didn't make;
*You cannot login to your email account, though you are sure your password and other settings are correct;
*   You are regularly not receiving some email messages from your colleagues that they insist that they sent to you;
*   Some private information that was sent or received exclusively by email was made known to a third party, though neither you nor your correspondent shared it with anyone else;
*   If on your account activity log (if your email provider offers one) you see that your account was accessed at time that you do not remember or from a place (or IP address) that you did not go to.
