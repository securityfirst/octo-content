<h1>Recipient security</h1><p>Regardless of what secure email tools you decide to use, keep in mind that every message has a sender and one or more recipients. You yourself are only part of the picture.<ul><li>Even if you access your email account securely, consider what precautions your contacts may or may not take when sending, reading and replying to messages.</li><li>Try to learn where your contacts' email providers are located, as well. Naturally, some countries are more aggressive than others when it comes to email surveillance. To ensure private communication, you and your contacts should all use secure email services hosted in relatively safe countries.</li><li>And, if you want to be certain that messages are not intercepted between your email server and a contact's email server, you might all choose to use accounts from the same provider. RiseUp is one good choice.</li></ul></p>
