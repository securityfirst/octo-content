# Tips on improving your email security

*   Always be careful when opening email attachments that you are not expecting, that come from someone you do not know or that contain suspicious subject lines. When opening emails like this, you should ensure that your anti-virus software is up-to-date and pay close attention to any warnings displayed by your browser or email program. See more about this in the [Malware](umbrella://lesson/malware) lesson.
*   Using anonymity software like Tor, which is described in the [Internet](umbrella://lesson/the-internet) lesson, can help you hide your chosen email service from anyone who might be monitoring your Internet connection.
*   When creating an account that you intend to use while remaining anonymous from your own email recipients, or from public forums to which you might post messages by email, you must be careful to avoid using Hotmail, Yahoo, or any other webmail provider that includes your IP address in the messages you send.
*   You may consider using several different, anonymous email accounts for communicating with different groups of people to protect of your contact network. You may also use different email accounts for signing up to Internet services which require email accounts.
*   After all above precautions it is still very important to beware of what you write in the messages and what impact would it have if it fell into the wrong hands. One way of increasing the security of information exchange is to develop a code system for sensitive information exchange, so you would not use real names of the people, real addresses of places, etc.
*   Remember that secure email will not do you any good if everything you type is recorded by spyware and periodically sent over the Internet to a third party. The [Malware](umbrella://lesson/malware) lesson and offers some advice on how to prevent this sort of thing, and the [Passwords](umbrella://lesson/passwords) lesson will help you protect your accounts.
