# What PGP Can't Do: Metadata

PGP is all about making sure the contents of a message are secret, genuine, and untampered with. But that's not the only privacy concern you might have. PGP does not protect your metadata-which is everything else, including the subject line of your email, or who you are communicating with and when. Metadata can provide extremely revealing information about you even when the content of your communication remains secret.

If you're exchanging PGP messages with a known dissident in your country, you may be in danger for simply communicating with them, even without those messages being decrypted. Indeed, in some countries you can face imprisonment simply for refusing to decrypt encrypted messages.

Protecting your metadata will require you to use other tools, such as Tor, at the same time as end-to-end encryption. You can learn how to do this in the [Internet lesson](umbrella://lesson/the-internet).
