# Burner phones

Phones that are used temporarily and then discarded are often referred to as burner phones. People who are trying to avoid surveillance sometimes try to change phones and numbers frequently to make it more difficult to recognise their communications. They will need to use prepaid phones (not associated with a personal credit card or bank account) and ensure that the phones and SIM cards were not registered with their identity; in some countries these steps are straightforward, while in others there may be legal or practical obstacles to obtaining anonymous mobile phone service.

There are a number of limitations to burners hiding your identity.

*   First, just swapping SIM cards offers minimal protection, because the network operator knows the history of which SIM cards have been used in which devices, and can track either individually or both together.
*   Second, governments have been developing mobile location analysis techniques where location tracking can be used to generate leads or hypotheses about whether multiple devices actually belong to the same person. There are many ways this can be done. For example, an analyst could check whether two devices tended to move together, or whether, even if they were in use at different times, they tended to be carried in the same physical locations.
*   A third problem for the successful anonymous use of telephone services is that people's calling patterns tend to be extremely distinctive. For example, you might habitually call your family members and your work colleagues. Even though each of these people receives calls from a wide range of people, you're likely the only person in the world who commonly calls both of them from the same number. So even if you suddenly changed your number, if you then resumed the same patterns in the calls you made or received, it would be straightforward to determine which new number was yours. Remember that this inference isn't made based only on the fact that you called one particular number, but rather on the uniqueness of the combination of all the numbers that you called.

Together, these facts mean that effective use of burner phones to hide from government surveillance requires, at a minimum:

*   Not reusing either SIM cards or devices;
*   Not carrying different devices together;
*   Not creating a physical association between the places where different devices are used;
*   And not calling or being called by the same people when using different devices.
*   (This isn't necessarily a complete list; for example, we haven't considered the risk of physical surveillance of the place where the phone was sold, or the places where it's used, or the possibility of software to recognize a particular person's voice as an automated method for determining who is speaking through a particular phone.)
