# WhatsApp

WhatsApp is the most popular mobile communication tool in the world, offering free messaging to individuals and groups and operating on all phone types. Until November 2014, using WhatsApp was considered highly insecure and was not recommend for anyone who required any level of security in their communications. It now offers strong encryption for some messages on some phones. 

Since November 2014, WhatsApp has been partnering with and integrating the secure code of a well-respected privacy and technology company (Open Whisper Systems) into its product. This means that its messages now have a very strong level of verifiable security, and WhatsApp can no longer easily view or be forced to handover messages to authorities.

However it is very important to note:

*   This only currently applies to users using WhatsApp on Android phones (users on Apple iOS, Windows Phone, Blackberry and Nokia will be only get the same protection at some point in the future.)
*   Only for messages from one individual to another individual (ie: not for group chats)
*   Does not encrypt any pictures sent once they arrive on the phone
*   While WhatsApp or others cannot view the content of your messages, they can still know that you are communication with someone (e.g metadata). In some cases, this may still have negative security consequences.

For these reasons we still recommend that you use [Signal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms) for secure messaging and calls.
