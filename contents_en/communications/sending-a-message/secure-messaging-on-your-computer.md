<h1>Secure messaging on your computer</h1><h2>Pidgin</h2><p>Instead of using Skype, Google Talk or MSN Messenger to send messages on your computer we recommend you use the secure, free, open-source tool, Pidgin, instead.</p><p>Pidgin is a chat program which lets you log in to accounts on multiple chat networks simultaneously. This means that you can be chatting with friends on MSN, talking to a friend on Google Talk, and sitting in a Yahoo chat room all at the same time. Pidgin runs on Windows, Linux, and other UNIX operating systems. </p><p>Pidgin supports many features of these chat networks, such as file transfers, away messages, emoticons, and typing notifications.</p><h2>Adium</h2><p>A good alternative to Pidgin that works with OS X on Macs is <a href="http://adium.im/">Adium</a>.</p>
