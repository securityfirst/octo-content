<p>Unfortunately bugging equipment is very cheap, widespread and effective. It is very, very hard to find eavesdropping equipment that has been planted against you ? many look like ordinary electronic items. In some countries, many high profile hotels are targets for regular bugging due to the frequent presence of business people, diplomats, NGOs etc.</p><p>The best tactic in avoiding such devices is to be unpredictable and change locations frequently if you are on high-risk travel and need to avoid surveillance. Be very wary of conducting sensitive activities in fixed locations (such as the office of a partner or a hotel room) for too long or repetitively. Limiting the provision of information in advance (for example, of which rooms will be used for conferences in specific hotels) is also useful as it reduces the time a hostile organisation has to plant a device. Outside in the open air can also be a good place to discuss sensitive matters. Make sure you are not overlooked.</p>If dealing with sensitive matters, always assume the room is bugged. Ensure that all mobile phones are turned off and batteries removed (as they can be turned on remotely without you knowing and used as a listening device). If possible you should remove batteries from phone before arriving at meeting location. (See the Mobile Phones lesson for more advice on avoiding the risks of phones) Masking noises like a loud radio or TV can be useful for reducing overheard conversations, although the most advanced devices can eliminate these extra sounds.</p><p>Unplug all unnecessary electronic devices from the electrical sockets. (If possible, turn off the electricity at the mains and check behind all electrical plug and light switch sockets.) Pay particular attention to smoke alarms, lamps, clocks etc. Don?t forget about staff such as cleaners or waiters who may be able to overhear what is going on.</p>
