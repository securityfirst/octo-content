# Five Rules of Counter-Surveillance

### 1. Trigger

This is the person who initially alerts the rest of the surveillance team when the target is on the move. The easiest person to find.

### 2. 10 to 2

The person carrying out the surveillance will try to stay out of a the 10 t0 2: the immediate eye line of the person they have put under surveillance

### 3. 3 times

This is the number of sightings of a surveillance team member you are aiming to achieve before you can confirm that you are under surveillance.

### 4. 3 sides of a square

This is the minimum number of turns you take to filter and reduce the possibility of seeing the same person by coincidence.

### 5. Breaking the box

This is the process of breaking out of the surveillance a team will try to keep you in. By breaking the box you increase the likelihood that they will make mistakes which you can observe and use to identify them.
