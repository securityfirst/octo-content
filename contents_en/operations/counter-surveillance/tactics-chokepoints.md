<h1>Tactics: Chokepoints</h1><p>Chokepoints are areas that anyone following you must pass through, and so allow for better observation and filtering of potential surveillance. Some naturally occurring chokepoints could be:<ul><li>Small relatively deserted laneway/alleyway with few paralleling lanes/roads</li><li>Traffic lights</li><li>Roundabouts</li><li>Road junctions</li><li>One way streets</li><li>Car park entrances/exits</li><li>Toll booths</li><li>Quiet roads</li><li>Long straight roads</li><li>Road works</li></ul></p><p>If using a roundabout as a chokepoint, try to record up to 10 of the vehicles following the vehicle which is potentially under surveillance  ? Try to note the registration and description (colour, make, model, unique descriptive features, number of occupants, presence of radios etc.) This is because a handover to another car may take place here ? so another person would now have the target in their line of sight. </p><p>Look for a handover: When turning, look for vehicles (or people on foot) who might match the profile of surveillance team members but then continue straight.</p>
