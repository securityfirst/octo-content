# Tactics: How to find the eyeball

When looking for repeat sightings in a vehicle, use the following tactics if safe to do so:

*   Look for repeat sightings
*   Use a false indicator
*   Drive fast / slow
*   Stop suddenly (try to have a reason for this - such as pulling in at a petrol station at the very last minute or taking a mobile phone call)
*   U-turn
*   Move into a filter lane turning right and at the last minute continue straight
*   Stop immediately after taking a left turn - will force others to overtake
*   Change lanes
*   Turn into a dead end
*   Enter onto a fast road such as a dual carriageway/motorway and then come off it quickly
*   Exit a dual carriageway/motorway and then come straight back onto it again
*   Use your mirrors
*   Create opportunities to look around
*   Stretch out the team
*   Create opportunities (if absolutely vital) to evade a surveillance team

If the political environment allows, pull in to a police station or ring colleagues/ backup to meet you at a designated spot where you can aim to safely lead any potential surveillance team members which you haven't broken contact with.
