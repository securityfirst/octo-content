# What do they look like?

There are a number of indicators that might let you know if a person is conducting surveillance on foot.

Look out for:

*   Bulky, loose clothing
*   Outdoor clothing
*   Military-style sports watch
*   Radio broadcast switch on their wrist
*   Earpiece with/without a wire
*   Comfortable footwear

Surveillance teams often try to use people who would easily be overlooked. Don't disregard people such as:

*   Females
*   Couples/groups
*   People wearing expensive clothes
*   Young/old looking people
*   People jogging
*   Beggars
*   Hotel maids, gardeners
*   Road workers
*   Commercial outfits (e.g. electricity company)
*   Unlikely minorities
*   People with a pram/dog/shopping bags

Tells' that might give away someone who is conducting surveillance on foot include:  

*   Readjusting personal equipment
*   Touching earpiece
*   Visibly talking into their microphones
*   Glazed eyes
*   Unusual behaviour or demeanour
*   Trying to avoid the target's gaze
*   Looking around corners/through windows
*   Mirroring behaviour
*   Stopping in unusual places

**Identifying Teams**

If you identify one potential surveillance member, you can use that knowledge to identify others. Members of a surveillance team can cross-contaminate other members:

*   By speaking directly to them
*   By looking in their direction
*    By using hand signals
*    By appearing or dressing in a similar manner
