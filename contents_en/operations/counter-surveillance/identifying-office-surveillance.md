<h2>How to Identify if Your Office is Under Surveillance</h2><p>Surveillance generally requires that the adversary is able to observe the activities of its targets. This means there are a limited number of physical sites they can use for surveillance. The best thing to do when looking for surveillance is to try to think like an adversary ? what might you do is you were trying to monitor your office? From where might you carry out such surveillance?</p><p><ul><li><b>Take a baseline</b><br>It is important to gain an understanding of what ?normal? conditions look like. (For example, where cars normally park or people normally stand).</li><li><b>Identify and record</b><br>From this, try to identify and record any unusual activities. (For example, people in locations where they shouldn?t be or aren?t normally).</li><li><b>Filter out coincidence</b><br>Filter out the chances that something could be a coincidence by concentrating on unusual activities and applying common sense filters (e.g. if someone is standing in a place where people don?t normally stand pay more attention to them. Do they look like they are from the area? Are they paying an unusual amount of attention to your activities?) Look for 3 signs that something is out of the ordinary or 3 repeat sightings.</li><li><b>Notify others</b><br>It is important to notify others of any suspicions and to keep a log of them. This allows the monitoring of patterns which otherwise might not emerge. For example, if you notice someone suspicious and then a colleague notices something else suspicious on a separate occasion but this information is not shared, then a valuable opportunity to confirm a security threat is missed.</li><li><b>Trust your senses</b><br>Trust your senses ? there may be clues of a potential arrest or violent attack. Often, HRDs report that there were warning signs prior to an attack, but they chose to ignore the warning signs or dismissed it as paranoia.</li></ul></p>
