<h1>Three Sides to a Square</h1><p>This is a technique used to identify several members of a team, create pressure on them and thin down their surveillance. It can be conducted alone or with a team.</p><p>It means taking a longer route than would logically make sense for someone going from point A to B.</p><p>Pick three or more reasons to be a) using such an unusual route and b) stopping along the way. These reasons should take the following things into account:<ul><li>It should be genuine and not suspicious ? there should be a believable reason for the detour. Remember, this is because you do not want any possible surveillance to know that you are checking for surveillance;</li><li>It should force a surveillance team member to go into the location with you to establish what you are doing, who you are meeting, or check for any signs that you may have a counter-surveillance team with you;</li><li>It should be a position where you can:<ul><li>Observe what is occurring</li><li>Observe the various exits/entrances</li><li>Be out of the target?s 10 to 2 eye line</li></ul></li><li>You should be able to quickly get on the move again ? so pay bills in advance, don?t get hot food, etc.</li></ul></p>
