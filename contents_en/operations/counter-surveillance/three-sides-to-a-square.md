# Three Sides to a Square

This is a technique used to identify several members of a team, create pressure on them and thin down their surveillance. It can be conducted alone or with a team.

It means taking a longer route than would logically make sense for someone going from point A to B.

Pick three or more reasons to be a) using such an unusual route and b) stopping along the way. These reasons should take the following things into account:

*   It should be genuine and not suspicious ? there should be a believable reason for the detour. Remember, this is because you do not want any possible surveillance to know that you are checking for surveillance;
*   It should force a surveillance team member to go into the location with you to establish what you are doing, who you are meeting, or check for any signs that you may have a counter-surveillance team with you;
*   Observe what is occurring
*   Observe the various exits/entrances
*   Be out of the target?s 10 to 2 eye line

You should be able to quickly get on the move again ? so pay bills in advance, don?t get hot food, etc.
