# Tactics: How to find the eyeball on foot

The eyeball refers to the member of the surveillance team who currently has you in their sights. Firstly - don?t look over your shoulder! Instead try to create situations to look observe all around you naturally ? including behind you:

*   Try using windows ? either looking through them or in their reflection ? or car mirrors;
*   Hold open doors for other people to enter and let them overtake you;
*   Cross a busy street and see who follows you;
*   Stop to look at posters or bus timetables, use an ATM, or buy something from a street vendor.
