Remove any organisation logos from vehicles which may be stolen. Ensure you keep copies of serial numbers of high-value equipment.</li><li>Give clear instructions regarding responsibilities and leadership roles to those staff staying behind.  Establish a means of continued communication between remaining staff and those evacuating. Provide authorisation documents to key national staff, if necessary.</li></ul></p>
