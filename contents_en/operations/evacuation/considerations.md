An evacuation is not easy for the evacuees or for those staying behind.  It is a very emotional event, giving rise to feelings of guilt, hurt, frustration, and powerlessness.  The departure of international aid organisations can have a variety of meanings to the local population, including the removal of a symbolic or real safety barrier. Thus, an evacuation is not a neutral act and may even aggravate a crisis.  When a field team evacuates it should consider providing a statement for the media and others explaining the organisation?s reasoning and any continuation or possible resumption of programmes.

**Self-evacuation.** Individuals that are working remotely from a local office, or who find themselves isolated during a crisis should use their judgement concerning the safety in their area.  All staff members should be authorised to evacuate on their own authority when they feel their safety is threatened, and should communicate with their manager during the process.

 **Evacuation refusal.** Staff who are instructed to evacuate or relocate, and who refuse, may face disciplinary action.  They are likely to be considered as staying at their own risk.

**National staff evacuation or relocation.** Many humanitarian organisations have a policy of only evacuating international staff.  If the manager believes that some or all national staff and/or their families face a direct threat, then they should consider organising or assisting their evacuation or relocation.

**Return and resumption of activities.**This may occur soon after evacuation or take a long time.  Re-establishing operations after an evacuation can be difficult. National staff who did not evacuate may have experienced hardship and threats to themselves and their families and this can understandably cause tensions. Due recognition of their achievement is important. Restoring relationships with staff, local authorities, beneficiaries, and the local population can be made easier if honesty, tact, and transparency are used prior to and during the evacuation, and on return.
