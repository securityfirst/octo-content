<p>Evacuation planning and rehearsals should be carried out regularly. Security situations can deteriorate rapidly, often without warning.  The evacuation plan should be prepared and all staff should understand an outline of it. The following issues should be considered when preparing your evacuation plan.</p><p><ul><li><b>Under what circumstances will you evacuate?</b> Outline the situations and indicators under which you will put this evacuation plan into action. Identify the situations under which you will:<ul><li><b>Suspend</b> work activities in response to security concerns;</li><li><b>Hibernate</b> by staff remaining where they are but keeping a low profile;</li><li><b>Relocate</b> with staff moving internally within the country or to a safe-house to escape security concerns, or;</li><li><b>Evacuate</b> with staff stopping work and leaving the country due to severe security concerns.</li></ul></li><li><b>Who will be evacuated</b> - It is essential that all staff members clearly understand their and their families? eligibility for evacuation or relocation assistance.<ul><li><b>Priority 1</b> ? International staff family members</li><li><b>Priority 2</b> ? Staff members who are in immediate personal danger due to the conditions of the crisis</li><li><b>Priority 3</b> ? Individuals other than essential staff</li><li><b>Priority 4</b> ? Essential staff</li></ul></li><li><b>Where will staff be evacuated to?</b>Identify a first-choice destination and an alternate destination for evacuation or relocation.  Organise an emergency safe-house or safe-haven if needed. Determine visa requirements, and the logistics that will be needed upon arrival.</li><li><b>How will staff be evacuated?</b>Establish a notification system and an assembly point.  Detail the route and method of evacuation. Check to ensure that these routes can be travelled under emergency conditions. Coordinate plans with embassies, UN agencies, and other NGOs as appropriate.</li><li><b>What goes and what stays?</b>Identify which documents, such as contracts, payroll records, etc. will be needed to re-establish operations once relocated or upon re-entry.  Other documents should be marked for destruction, or left behind, as appropriate.  Consider how evacuated documents will be perceived if seized by a particular person or group.  They may contain information that could put those evacuating at risk, and would be better destroyed.</li><li><b>Who is responsible for the various tasks during an evacuation?</b> During crises key staff will be fully occupied so responsibilities for evacuation should be clearly defined during the planning stage.</li><li><b>What will be the expected impact of evacuation on the operation?</b>Will the office be closed and, if so, how?  What are the policies and plans for continuing operations through national staff members acting on their own?  Or through contractors, if feasible and appropriate?</li></ul></p>
