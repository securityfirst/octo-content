<h1>Questioning Techniques</h1><p>Questioning techniques to be aware of include:<ul><li>Asking trivial information to get you talking and then shifting to more sensitive information when they feel you are co-operative;</li><li>Threatening, then reducing the threat (known commonly as ?good cop?, ?bad cop?);</li><li>Physical intimidation;</li><li>Asking you the same questions repeatedly to see if there is any inconsistency in what you are saying. You may be asked to give the same timeline backwards to look for inconsistencies;</li><li>Claiming that your co-workers or others have made allegations against you or that they have specific evidence against you. Their aim is to get you to confirm things they are suspicious about. Don?t voluntarily confirm what might just be their suspicions.</li></ul></p>
