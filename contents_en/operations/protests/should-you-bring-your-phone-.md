Activists and human rights defenders are increasingly documenting their protests using cameras and mobile phones ? often to powerful effect. The following are useful tips for you to remember if you are going to a protest and are concerned about protecting your electronic devices if you?re detained by police.

Think carefully about what?s on your phone before bringing it to a protest. Your phone contains a wealth of private data, which can include your list of contacts, the people you have recently called, your text messages and email, photos and video, GPS location data, your web browsing history and passwords, and the contents of your social media accounts. Through stored passwords or active logins, access to the device can allow someone to obtain yet even more information on remote servers. (You can log out of these services).

In many countries, people are required to register their SIM cards when they purchase a mobile phone. If you take your mobile phone with you to a protest, it makes it easy for the government to figure out that you are there. If you need to keep your participation in a protest secret from governments or law enforcement, cover your face so that it is harder to identify you from photos. However, do note that masks may get you into trouble in some locations due to anti-mask laws.

**If it is important to keep your presence at the protest concealed, do not take your mobile phone with you.**

**If you absolutely must bring a mobile phone with you, try to bring one that is not registered in your name.**
