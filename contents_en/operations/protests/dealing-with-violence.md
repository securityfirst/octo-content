<p>Violence in a crowd situation can include physical harassment, thrown debris, petrol bombs, fire, use of weapons or tear gas. To mitigate such dangers, you should take all the precautions outlined under ?Dealing with Crushes? as well as the following:<ul><li>Wear suitable protective clothing e.g. fire retardant natural fibres.</li><li>Trust your instincts ? crowds can turn very quickly. If you sense it is becoming unsafe or you are getting too much attention, withdraw to a safe area.</li><li>If faced with direct aggression / if weapons appear, withdraw to a safe area immediately and tell your team.</li><li>Take riot kits if appropriate. Riot kits containing equipment (safety glasses, bump cap, mask etc) and first aid kits are made available by large media organisations.</li></ul></p>
