<p>Please note that deliberately concealing or destroying evidence may be considered an illegal act in itself in some jurisdictions (including many social democracies).</p><p>Be sure you understand the law and the risks before engaging in this plan. For instance, if you are protesting in a country with a strong tradition of the rule of law and where protesting in itself is not a crime, it may be that conspiring to lock out law enforcement from your accounts may lead to you breaking the law when previously you would be able to leave without charge.</p><p>On the other hand, if you are concerned for the physical safety of you and your colleagues at the hands of a unchecked militia, protecting your contacts? identities and your own data from them may be a greater priority than complying with an investigation.</p>
