Difficulty:Beginner
Order:3
---
<p><ul><li>You should assume that you might be stopped and searched. Assume that anything you have written will be copied or read and prepare accordingly.</li><li>Make sure all sensitive notes are typed up/ photographed and then encrypted. (See the Protecting Files lesson for advice on how to encrypt files.)</li><li>To prepare for the long-term confiscation of your equipment at an exit port, you should backup key files remotely, such as to your secure email.</li><li>Before departure, make sure to remove any sensitive paper waste from your room and dispose of it safely elsewhere. If necessary, soak paper in water to ensure it is unreadable.</li><li>At a suitable time, speak with your colleagues (if travelling with them) about what you will say if stopped and questioned when leaving the country. It might be the case that certain parts of the trip (such as meeting with a high-risk activist) you do not want to mention to the authorities. Any plan of what you agree to say should be:<ul><li>Simple;</li><li>Easily repeatable;</li><li>Verifiable.</li></ul></li><li>When leaving the country, the same principles as entering apply. Keep electronics and sensitive material on you at all times. If necessary, hide a small USB or micro SD card somewhere it is harder to find.</li></ul></p>
