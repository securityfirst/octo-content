*   You should assume that you might be stopped and searched. Assume that anything you have written will be copied or read and prepare accordingly.
*   Make sure all sensitive notes are typed up/ photographed and then encrypted. (See the Protecting Files lesson for advice on how to encrypt files.)
*   To prepare for the long-term confiscation of your equipment at an exit port, you should backup key files remotely, such as to your secure email.
*   Before departure, make sure to remove any sensitive paper waste from your room and dispose of it safely elsewhere. If necessary, soak paper in water to ensure it is unreadable.
*   Simple;
*   Easily repeatable;
*   Verifiable.

When leaving the country, the same principles as entering apply. Keep electronics and sensitive material on you at all times. If necessary, hide a small USB or micro SD card somewhere it is harder to find.
