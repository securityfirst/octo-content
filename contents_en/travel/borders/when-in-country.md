*   If using a paper notebook, try to minimise any potential data loss by making up short codes that only you understand. For example, if you are meeting a high-risk activist, give them a different name and refer to them as that in your notes. Don?t mix sensitive information with easily identifiable information.
*   Don?t forget about receipts, tickets, bills etc. They can link sensitive activists to your work if not carefully protected.
*   Keep sensitive information in another place (e.g. interview notes in a notebook but sensitive names and locations securely emailed to yourself.)
*   Type up or take photos of your most sensitive written notes as soon as possible and securely email them to yourself and/or keep them on an encrypted drive. (See the Protecting Files lesson for advice on how to encrypt files.)
*   Avoid taking paper reports or other information from the organisations and people that you work with - if your bags are searched they will link you. Instead, ask them to give or email you digital copies if possible.
*   Dispose of sensitive paper waste immediately. Avoid doing this in locations like hotel rooms or offices where it might be taken by cleaners or security staff. If necessary, soak paper in water to ensure it is unreadable.
*   Minimise the amount of security related information you give to people that you meet. At meetings and during other interactions, avoid giving details of future operational and travel plans.
*   Travel by different routes at different times if possible in high-risk areas.
*   Avoid walking alone/at night if possible.
*   Advise hotel staff not to provide information on your activities; although be aware they could be monitoring you, too.
*   Try to memorize emergency phone numbers.
*   Agree a simple discreet signal with any colleagues that can alert them to nearby danger. It should be something easy to do but not something that would happen accidentally.
*   Always wear seatbelts!
