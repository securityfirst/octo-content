[Title]: # (When Entering Country)
[Difficulty]: # (Beginner)
[Order]: # (1)

*   Agree in advance with colleagues what you will say. Discuss any red lines you will not cross (e.g. giving information about high risk activists who you intend on meeting)
*   In some environments, it is best not to attract attention by travelling in a group, so sit separately and approach immigration separately. (Although bare in mind that authorities often know if big organisations are coming to the country anyway.)
*   Say/do nothing sensitive on plane ? many human rights defenders have been arrested because they were overheard speaking about their activities.
*   Provide only minimal information to immigration about activities.
*   It may not be within the remit of your organisation to lie but neither should you volunteer information unnecessarily.
*   Be prepared to be questioned about your activities in other countries/visas marked in your passport.
*   Be polite but firm with authorities.
*   Decide in advance if you are going to put the actual hotel and location where you are staying on the visa entry form. (Consider risk vs. benefit)
*   Do not get separated from your belongings, especially electronic items. If they are taken away from you, you should assume that they have been compromised.
*   Keep phones off until well outside airport. Airports are common areas for tracking and viruses.
*   Keep Wi-Fi off if not vital ? do not connect to airport Wi-Fi.
*   Agree in advance with colleagues a location in the building where you will meet after immigration and a set time to turn on mobile phones if you have not met at this point and need to communicate.
