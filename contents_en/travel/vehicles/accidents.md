Traffic accidents can be minimized by implementing defensive driver training and other precautions, but they can never be avoided entirely. When an accident is mishandled, it can quickly change from an unfortunate occurrence into a security risk. In extreme situations, it can trigger violence or threats of retribution.

The following procedures are useful when involved in an accident.

*   Quickly discern the attitudes and actions of people around the accident site to ensure that you are not at risk by staying.
*   Do not leave the site unless your safety is jeopardized and then only to drive to the nearest police or military post.
*   Make site safe and visible to other traffic.
*   Provide care and assistance as appropriate.
*   As appropriate, contact local authorities immediately and cooperate as required.
*   Contact the your office as soon as practical.
*   If feasible, take pictures of the scene and record the names and contact information of witnesses, responding authorities, and those involved.
*   When approaching an accident involving other vehicles consider safety and security, taking care not to become involved in a second accident while responding.

Vehicle accidents are the main cause of injury and fatality among NGO staff. Avoiding excessive speed, following applicable traffic laws, and wearing seat belts minimize the chances of injury.

Offices should implement a transportation policy that ensures vehicles are maintained in a state of operational readiness; journeys are planned; and vehicle users are prepared to respond to a range of possible incidents. An accident report format should be placed in the logbook of each vehicle.
