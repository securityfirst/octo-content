[Title]: # (At Checkpoint)
[Difficulty]: # (Beginner)
[Order]: # (2)

You should know the accepted etiquette for passing through a checkpoint in your area. It is always important to stay calm and clearly demonstrate that you are not a threat.

*   Stop a few meters from the barrier
*   Keep engine running unless told otherwise
*   Remain in the vehicle unless asked to get out
*   If asked to get out release seatbelt slowly so it does not look like you are reaching for a gun
*   Avoid any sudden movements in the car ? if moving announce what you are doing before you do it, and move slowly
*   Do not laugh or giggle
*   Keep hands visible
*   If vehicle is searched, comply
*   Be friendly, co-operative and alert. Treat the soldiers or police with respect.  They have a boring job to do, and are likely to give you an easier time if you show an interest in them. If appropriate, chat a little, perhaps about their family.
*   If they ask you to do things that are inappropriate, be polite but firm in refusing, and use gentle humour if appropriate.
*   NB. A soldier asking for money is a negotiation. A solider pointing his gun at you and demanding money is armed robbery. If threatened with a weapon, comply calmly with their instructions.
*   If anything stolen, politely ask for it back (use your judgement; if the situation is threatening it may be best to accept the loss). If there is the possibility of violence at a checkpoint report the incident to a more senior officer once your journey is complete.
*   If at all possible, refuse lifts to armed or uniformed personnel. Be prepared to be turned back if your organizational policy forbids it.
*   Avoid looking back
*   Once the checkpoint has been cleared and you are out of view report back in to base that you are continuing on your route.
