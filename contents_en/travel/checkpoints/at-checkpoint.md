<p>You should know the accepted etiquette for passing through a checkpoint in your area. It is always important to stay calm and clearly demonstrate that you are not a threat.</p><p><ul><li>Stop a few meters from the barrier</li><li>Keep engine running unless told otherwise</li><li>Remain in the vehicle unless asked to get out</li><li>If asked to get out release seatbelt slowly so it does not look like you are reaching for a gun</li><li>Avoid any sudden movements in the car ? if moving announce what you are doing before you do it, and move slowly</li><li>Do not laugh or giggle</li><li>Keep hands visible</li><li>If vehicle is searched, comply</li><li>Be friendly, co-operative and alert. Treat the soldiers or police with respect.  They have a boring job to do, and are likely to give you an easier time if you show an interest in them. If appropriate, chat a little, perhaps about their family.</li><li>If they ask you to do things that are inappropriate, be polite but firm in refusing, and use gentle humour if appropriate.</li><li>NB. A soldier asking for money is a negotiation. A solider pointing his gun at you and demanding money is armed robbery. If threatened with a weapon, comply calmly with their instructions.</li><li>If anything stolen, politely ask for it back (use your judgement; if the situation is threatening it may be best to accept the loss). If there is the possibility of violence at a checkpoint report the incident to a more senior officer once your journey is complete.</li><li>If at all possible, refuse lifts to armed or uniformed personnel. Be prepared to be turned back if your organizational policy forbids it.</li><li>Avoid looking back</li><li>Once the checkpoint has been cleared and you are out of view report back in to base that you are continuing on your route.</li></ul></p>
