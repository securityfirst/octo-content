Many checkpoints have a legitimate purpose, for example to prevent weapons from entering an area. Some checkpoints, however, are designed to harass people or as a cover for ambush, theft or violence. It is important to recognise the difference between a legal, sanctioned checkpoint and one designed for the gain of the checkpoint personnel.

You first need to rapidly assess the nature of the checkpoint.

*   Where it is located?
*   Who is manning it?
*   What does their mood appear to be?
*   Are there any signs of trouble?

 Checkpoints at crossroads, bridges, mountain passes and town entrances and exits are to be expected, and are likely to have been set up for the general monitoring of all passers-by. Checkpoints in the middle of a forest or on a mountain road away from habitation may exist for a more ominous purpose. Checkpoints manned by regular army and police forces may be less problematic than ones manned by irregulars.

If you suspect that there is a risk of violence or other serious problems, turn round and drive steadily away, if it is safe to do so.

Before approaching or leaving a checkpoint, inform base by radio. Do so in a discreet way, far enough from the checkpoint to avoid them seeing that you are using the radio
