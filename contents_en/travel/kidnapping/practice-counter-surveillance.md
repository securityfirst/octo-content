In simple terms this means ?watch to see if someone is watching you?. A successful kidnapping normally needs planning, and the perpetrators will be watching the residence, office and movements of their identified target for some time before making their move. They may try to find out more about the residence by presenting themselves as servicemen, or checking the locks of doors and windows while staff are away. They may follow a target in a car to establish routines and identify the ideal point at which to strike. Practicing counter-surveillance may also make you aware of an imminent attack.

*   Be observant and watch for anything unusual
*   Note if someone starts asking numerous unexpected questions or takes an unexpected interest in you are or the work that you do.
*   Situational awareness is vital
*   Know the ?choke points? on your route
*   Multiple sightingsÂ of the same person, vehicle, or activity may confirm you?re being watched.
*   If you are suspicious that you are being followed you can speed up, slow down, make three right turns, stall at a green light and continue just as the lights change back to red, take a one way street, or make a dead stop. Check if any cars following are doing the same thing.
Practicing counter-surveillance effectively requires constant attention and knowledge about the local environment, including who belongs in the locality and who does not. See the Counter-surveillance lesson for more detailed advice.
