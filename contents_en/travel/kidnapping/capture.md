Your objective is to survive, hence:<ul><li>Be calm and cooperative, speak only when spoken to, listen carefully and attentively, avoid sudden moves. Do not behave aggressively or try to be a hero: accept the situation.</li><li>If in a group, try not to be separated. Appoint one person to speak for the group, selected on the basis of ability rather than formal rank.</li><li>Do not attempt to escape and or to physically resist.</li><li>Do not make eye contact it may be mistaken for aggression.</li><li>Recognise that fear and shock are normal reactions.</li></ul></p>
