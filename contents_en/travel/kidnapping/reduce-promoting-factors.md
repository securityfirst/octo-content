In environments where a host is responsible for the wellbeing of their guests, it might be a good idea to obtain local protection. Likewise, asking respected elders to join a site visit may offer a form of protection. Only good knowledge of the context will determine whether this tactic will reduce the risk.
*   **Be aware of how work is received**If the political or conflict situation is putting your work at a heightened risk be prepared to suspend the programme if necessary and leave the country for a period of time if appropriate. (See Evacuation lesson for more advice on this)
*   **Have a public policy of no ransom**
