If kidnap occurs, the organisation should immediately set up a crisis management team, in HQ if possible. It should be made clear at once which manager has responsibility for managing the incident.  That manager should then consider the following actions, depending on the circumstances and his or her assessment of the best course of action:

*   Inform the local police and other appropriate authorities
*   Inform all relevant parties of the name and contact details of the incident manager.  Request that no action be taken in relation to the incident without prior agreement with him or her.
*   Contacting Next of Kin.  This should be a top priority.  Failure to do this quickly can damage the relationship of trust with the staff member's family, particularly if they first hear the news through the media.  This could then make the management of the crisis much more difficult.
*   Answering enquiries from the press
*   Keeping contact with all relevant staff and other agencies
*   Providing 24-hour communications and logging all messages and events
*   Marking maps
*   Ensuring that the crisis management team has sufficient food, water and rest
